  ]
}
```

### Test OpenAI Intent Detection
```http
POST /openai/test
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "test_query": "How much energy did my AC use last week?"
}
```
Tests OpenAI intent detection with a specific query.

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "query": "How much energy did my AC use last week?",
  "intent_detection": {
    "intent": "device_energy",
    "device": "AC",
    "time_period": "week",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "extracted_info": {
      "device_name": "AC",
      "time_range": "last week",
      "query_type": "energy_consumption"
    }
  },
  "success": true
}
```

## Query Processing

### Intent Types

1. **Device Energy** (`device_energy`)
   - Queries about specific device consumption
   - Example: "How much energy did my AC use last week?"

2. **Device Comparison** (`device_comparison`)
   - Compares energy usage across devices
   - Example: "Which devices use the most power?"

3. **Total Consumption** (`total_consumption`)
   - Overall energy consumption summaries
   - Example: "What's my total energy usage this month?"

4. **Energy Analysis** (`energy_analysis`)
   - Detailed analysis and insights
   - Example: "Analyze my energy consumption patterns"

5. **Cost Analysis** (`cost_analysis`)
   - Cost calculations and estimates
   - Example: "What's my energy cost for this week?"
